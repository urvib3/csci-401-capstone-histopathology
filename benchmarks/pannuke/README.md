# PanNuke Benchmark

Experiments using the PanNuke histopathology dataset.

## Goal

Use PanNuke to test a baseline model for nucleus detection and classification, then examine how the predictions could later be converted into variables for the WCSP solver.

## What to Do

1. **Download the PanNuke dataset**
   - Use the benchmark link provided by the professor.
   - Keep the official dataset folds/splits.

2. **Understand the labels**
   PanNuke contains five main nucleus classes:
   - Neoplastic
   - Inflammatory
   - Connective
   - Dead
   - Non-neoplastic epithelial

3. **Run a baseline**
   - Start with **HoVer-Net**.
   - Use a pretrained PanNuke checkpoint if available.
   - If time allows, test another model such as CellViT for comparison.

4. **Record the results**
   Save basic results such as:
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 score
   - Panoptic Quality (PQ), if available
   - Approximate runtime

5. **Inspect the predictions**
   Look at a few example images and check:
   - Are nuclei detected correctly?
   - Which cell types are commonly confused?
   - Are the predicted cell locations and classes usable for the WCSP pipeline?

6. **Document important decisions**
   Record:
   - Baseline model used
   - Dataset fold/split
   - Pretrained checkpoint used
   - Important preprocessing steps
   - Evaluation metrics
   - Any issues encountered

## Connection to WCSP

The predicted nuclei can later become WCSP variables. Model probabilities can be used to create unary costs, while spatial relationships between nearby cells can be used for biological constraints.
